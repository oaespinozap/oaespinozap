I am very interested in programming and I am currently learning Java and HTML. I am looking to collaborate on projects related to these topics. If you want to contact me, you can do so through: omarespinozaa@gmail.com.

I define myself as an enthusiastic person committed to continuous learning. I hope to connect with others who share my interests!

Also, as a curious fact, I am an international chef.
